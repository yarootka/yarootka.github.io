- Works as [Jekyll Hook](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#hooks), does not require an additional Ruby GEM.

#### Requirements
* Jekyll 3.x

### Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/git-no/jekyll-breadcrumbs/releases) and unpack the file.

2. Copy the folders *_includes* and *_plugins* to your Jekyll repository.

  If you do not use jekyll-language-plugin you can or should skip the lang-tag.rb file (it translates breadcrumbs and requires [jekyll-language-plugin](https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-language-plugin)).
3. Copy the *breadcrumb-style.css* into your CSS directory and link the file within your HTML Header or copy the code into your existing CSS file.

### Configuration
1. Include the nav-breadcrumb.html in your Jekyll code where every you want to place the breadcrumbs by:
  ```
  {% include nav-breadcrumbs.html %}
  ```

2. As default the root breadcrumb is visible as *Start*. If you want to integrate an image as root breadcrumb, e.g. as SVG, update the icon.svg with your SVG. If you want to integrate a other image type update icon.html. Also change the line of code in nav-breadcrumbs.html from

  ```
  <a class="breadcrumb-item" href={{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}>Start</a>
  ```
  to
  ```
  {% include icon.html class="breadcrumb-item" %}
  ```

3. Use YAML *title* or *breadcrumb* to define the title of breadcrumb items.

  ```
  ---
  title: Legal and Terms
  ---
  ```  
  or if you already use YAML title
  ```
  ---
  title: Legal and Terms
  breadcrumb: Legal
  ---
  ```
  YAML *breadcrumb:* is optional and overrules YAML title, in case you want a different title in breadcrumb item as the page title.

4. If you use the [jekyll-language-plugin](https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-language-plugin) change the line of code in nav-breadcrumbs.html from

  ```
  {% assign caption = crumb.title %}
  ```
  to
  ```
  {% assign subset = crumb.subset %}
  {% if subset %}
    {% capture caption %}{% tif subset %}{% endcapture %}
  {% else %}
    {% assign caption = crumb.title %}
  {% endif %}
  ```
  to get breadcrumb items translated.

## Note
* If you use [jekyll-language-plugin](https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-language-plugin) jekyll-breadcrumbs will translate each breadcrumb item if YAML *subset* in the page is set. If so this plugin will seek at first for *breadcrumb* within the subset of the language file, if breadcrumb is not found in the langauge file it will look for title within the subset.

## Contribution
This Jekyll plugin is an extension of the [Simple Breadcrumbs in Jekyll 3](https://envygeeks.io/2015/12/06/super-simple-breadcrumbs-in-jekyll-3-0/) from the [envygeeks](https://github.com/envygeeks). Thank you very much [envygeeks](https://github.com/envygeeks) for sharing the code and thank you for all the Jekyll effort and development. We love Jekyll.
